# 7.4. Installing the manufacturing server package

[7.4. Installing the manufacturing server package](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/gu-in/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/assembly_automatically-provisioning-and-onboarding-rhel-for-edge-devices_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#proc_installing-the-manufacturing-server-package_assembly_automatically-provisioning-and-onboarding-rhel-for-edge-devices)

In the procedure indicates to install **fdo-manufacturing-server** rpm package, but if you install the **fdo-admin-cli** rpm package (section 7.3) you do not need to install it. It is installed as a dependence.

It is not necessary to create the **/usr/share/doc/fdo/manufacturing-server.yml** file or even generate certs, due to when the **fdo-manufacturing-server** package is installed all the configuration and certificates are automatically created under **/etc/fdo/aio/** so the documentation is quite confusing. And should explain that all the configuration is created at installation time and provide the information about how to customize that configuration if needed.

I do not understand point 5 in the procedure. It talks about executing manufacturer server on a Podman container (first reference to containers):

```
$ cat /usr/share/doc/fdo/manufacturing-server.yml
```

???

About this yaml file:

* What is its purpose?
* What service use it?
* How it is used?
* ...

The additional resources section:

* The [manufacturing-server.yml example](https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/blob/main/examples/config/manufacturing-server.yml) points to the example yaml file in github which is the same that is deployed in the server (**/usr/share/doc/fdo/manufacturing-server.yml**) instead of that a completely functional file should be shown as a true example.

Starting the **fdo-manufacturing-server** using the default configuration fails:

```
