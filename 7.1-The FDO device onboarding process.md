# 7.1. The FDO device onboarding process

[7.1. The FDO device onboarding process](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/gu-in/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/assembly_automatically-provisioning-and-onboarding-rhel-for-edge-devices_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#con_the-fdo-process-of-device-onboarding_assembly_automatically-provisioning-and-onboarding-rhel-for-edge-devices)

In **Figure 7.1. Deploying RHEL for Edge in non-network environment**:

* **Rendevouz Server** What is it? Role?
* **Owner Management Server** What is it? Role?

The above should be explained. An introduction to these roles should be included (or a link to the information).

## Conclussions

Some roles are mentioned but not explained (at least in a clear way). These concepts are new to RHEL so our customers do not know them. They should be explained in a more detailed way. Are they deployed in the same server or not? ...

Some components will be installed:

```
root@rhel9 keys]# systemctl list-unit-files | grep fdo
fdo-aio.service                            enabled         disabled
fdo-client-linuxapp.service                disabled        disabled
fdo-manufacturing-server.service           disabled        disabled
fdo-owner-onboarding-server.service        disabled        disabled
fdo-rendezvous-server.service              disabled        disabled
fdo-serviceinfo-api-server.service         disabled        disabled
[root@rhel9 keys]# 
```
 How are they related to the **Rendevouz Server** or **Owner Management Server**?

 FDO infrastructure should be described at the beginning instead of describing the onboarding process with FDO first. Customer will need to understand the FDO infrastructure, how to configure and troubleshoot it.
